1. The app has a client ID, secret, issuer, and audience. This allows the app to be available via Okta.
    ie. deactivating the app in Okta would render it unable o return data

    ie. user needs to pass username/password -> get stateToken
        -> MFA
        -> once authenticated, check that user has access to ZAP
